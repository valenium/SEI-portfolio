# Valerie Lim
I am a full stack software developer with PM, operations, customer success, and people management from the cybersecurity and gaming industry. After spending 3 years working alongside with and leading development and delivery teams, I was inspired to immerse myself deeper into the tech and jumpstart a career into development and improve my contributions to the PM space.
